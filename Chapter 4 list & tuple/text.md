Feature	                                        Description

Ordered	                    Elements have a defined order. You can access   
                            them by index like in a list.

Immutable	                Once a tuple is created, you cannot change its 
                            values (no add, delete, or modify).

Allows duplicates	        Yes, you can have repeated values.

Heterogeneous	            Tuples can store different data types: int, 
                            str, float, etc.
